# code_library_scheme
Basic console application for structuring content. Not for editing (done manually in .txt-file), just for viewing: either view table of content (command "toc") or an entry (enter corresponding number). The entries are all stored in a single .txt-file. Each entry needs to end with two empty lines as divider.
